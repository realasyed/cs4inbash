# Purpose

I love Linux and Bash, and I think recreating all of my CS4 assignments in the latter would be a good way to learn it.
I do not intend for these scripts to be very polished; I am learning as I go. However, if I learn of optimizations, I
may include a new function with a name like  `better_[FUNCTION NAME]`. I might not recreate everything, as some of the
lessons from my CS class were about OOP, which Bash does not seem to support. I'll cross this bridge when I get to it.
