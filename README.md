## Usage

To use the functions in these scripts you have to run `source whatever_script.sh`. You can (but maybe should not) place
that line in your `.bashrc` file, which would let you use these functions whenever you want. 

## Purpose

I love Linux and Bash, and I think recreating all of my CS4 assignments in the latter would be a good way to learn it.
I do not intend for these scripts to be very polished; I am learning as I go. However, if I learn of optimizations, I
may include a new function with a name like  `better_[FUNCTION NAME]`. I might not recreate everything, as some of the
lessons from my CS class were about OOP, which Bash does not seem to support. I'll cross this bridge when I get to it.

## Resources

Here is a list of resources that I have found helpful so far:

- The `info bash` command and its various sub-pages.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bash/index.php) and [Phoenix NAP](https://phoenixnap.com/) for syntax help. 
- [Redowan's Reflections](https://rednafi.com/misc/bash_namerefs/) for understanding namerefs and the `declare` command.
